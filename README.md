# A re-implementation of gridfinity for OpenSCAD.

Inspired by https://github.com/kennetek/gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad, this version is more
limited but seems to perform a bit better in stl output time.

## Features
Supports text labels on the bin tabs, or one label across all bin tabs.


## Limitations

Currently only supports bin tabs that are full-width.

## Thanks
It's hard to measure fonts in OpenSCAD.  Thanks to Alexander Pruss who made this much easier with https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3004457.
